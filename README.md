## YAN85 Emulator for babyrev_level19.0

I am still working on it, and I suck at it. Will update the README once it's complete.
Don't copy, it doesn't work 😮‍💨

Update: The Disassembler (i named it interpreter.py) works fine and i used it to solve challs by manually understanding the translated YAN instuction, also it gave me quite good idea for writing the emulator.

The Emulator Works somehow too, and if you approach it by cheacking the CMP you can do it with this emulator, but i have messed up the stack, will be fixing it when i approach higher levels.
